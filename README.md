# High Intensity Peak Analysis


#### Beta


Calculate high intensity Peaks from a given file and creates  
different output files.  
Tested with files provided by Fiji.  
Sample Data is provided in sampleData Folder.  
Your data might work if the txt is the structure as the files in sampleData.  
Important: Each entry is divided by a Tabstop (\t)  
If the Tabstop is missing, the program will fail!

Important notice:  
A path with multiple or a single blank is not recommended!
High Intensity Peak Analysis will try to fix the path but this isnÂ´t a 
100% chance that it will work

## Command Line Arguments:

- [-V / --verbose]: Verbose mode -> Verbose output of Calculations  
- [-H / --highintense]: Skips the main menu and jumps directly to the High Intensity Peak Analyzer Tool
- [-r / --restore]: Restores the default config.ini

You can combine several argument e.g
